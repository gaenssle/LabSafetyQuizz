      { option: "I open the flask and remove the volume.", reaction: "You fool! Now your culture is contaminated with all sorts of stuff and you can start all over.", color: "#B90E0A" },
      { option: "I open the flask in the fume hood and remove the volume.", reaction: "You fool! You mistake the fume hood for a sterile biological safety cabinet.

      { option: "I put a dummy with the same weight opposite to my sample, close the lid, and click on start.", reaction: "Like a boss! After the spin is complete, you take your sample out.", color: "green" },
      { option: "I put a dummy with the same volume opposite to my sample, close the lid, and click on start.", reaction: "You fool! Volume is not always equal to weight.

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1
  },

      { option: "I pour it into a plastic tube and throw it into the bin for chemical waste.", reaction: "You fool! This is only for chemical waste. Your nasty bacteria are not allowed to leave the lab alive!", color: "#B90E0A" },

    question: "You have needles left on your bench. What do you do with them?",
    answers: [

      { option: "I clean them and store them for later use.", reaction: "You fool! The needles are intended for single-use, and you spend more time cleaning them than they are worth and still contaminate your next sample.", color: "#B90E0A" },

    correctAnswer: 1
  },
  {
    question: "On your way out, you come across two unlabeled beakers with clear solutions (one of them has a pungent smell). What do you do?",
    answers: [
      { option: "I assume it's water and use it to fill up the water bath.", reaction: "You fool! It was concentrated sulfuric acid! Boiling droplets of acid fly everywhere and chemically burn your hands and face.", color: "#B90E0A" },
      { option: "I put both of them into the fume hood and mark them as unknown to warn others before you search for the owner.", reaction: "Like a boss! You will find the owner of the beaker and tell them to label their stuff and store it correctly.", color: "green" },
      { option: "I put them somewhere where they don't bother anyone.", reaction: "You fool! One of them is isopropyl alcohol. As you put it next to the window into the sun where it evaporates and explodes after ignition by a nearby flame.", color: "#B90E0A" }
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1
